## Difficulty
Easy

## Setup
1. Download the files into your preffered html/css/js editor.

## The Task
You are starting off with a photo album website that is supposed to be filled with winter pictures, but there are some summer pictures in there. 
There is a button on the top that says "fix" that will run a javascript function on click. It is your job to create the fix function.
The fix function will use DOM to remove the summer pictures, as well as add some new winter pictures, using some of the photos in the winter folder.
